# React Portfolio

The portfolio allows the user to view my resume, important projects, and links them to my github and linkedin. It allows me to display my new skills learned since the last portfolio submission. 

# Features

The portfolio integrates Javascript to remove the need for multiple HMTL documents. It includes an iframe resume as well as active buttons that allow the user to view important projects.
